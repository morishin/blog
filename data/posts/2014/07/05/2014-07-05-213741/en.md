# Created a Mac app that lights up the keyboard in response to keystrokes: "LightningKeyboard"

I always thought the backlight of the MacBook keyboard was useless since it was always off, but I thought it would be cool to make it light up in response to keystrokes.

## Functionality

When you hit a key, it lights up briefly and then fades away. <br/>
It only blinks &lt;blink&gt;blink blink blink&lt;/blink&gt; when you press the Enter key.

It makes typing a lot more fun, which is great. <br/>
It's even more enjoyable when used together with [NoisyTyper](http://fffff.at/noisy-typer-a-typewriter-for-your-laptop/).

## Download

You can download it here. <br/>

## Notes

* It’s pointless if the room is bright.
* <s>It seems to only work on OS X 10.9 Mavericks.</s> I received information that it works on Yosemite as well (updated).
* An icon will appear in the menu bar once it starts, so to quit, do it from there. <br/> ![menu](http://gyazo.com/f0d313f64d6f387666f8bcb626d505e5.png)
* Also, as mentioned in the startup dialog, you need to add the app to the list as shown in the screenshot below for it to work. <br/> ![pref](http://cdn-ak.f.st-hatena.com/images/fotolife/m/morishin127/20140705/20140705211317.png)

Please enjoy it in a dark room.
