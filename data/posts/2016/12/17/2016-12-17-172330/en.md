The Ergodox is trending lately, and I've been a bit curious about keyboards that are split into left and right halves. It seems that by separating the two sides, you can type in a natural posture with your chest open, which is comfortable.

I thought I would try it out with what I already have, so I connected an external keyboard to my MBP and placed my left hand on the MBP's keyboard and my right hand on the external keyboard. I was typing using the left half of the MBP's keyboard and the right half of the external keyboard, and surprisingly, it was quite easy. I worked in this style for about two months. I found it comfortable to have them quite far apart, so I used them about the distance shown in the photo, with the Magic Trackpad placed to the right of the right-hand keyboard. Although it's cropped, there is a display in the middle.

This style was becoming established, but I always felt that the key feel was different between the left and right sides. So, I wanted a proper split keyboard with the same keys, and I purchased the [MISTEL BAROCCO MD600](http://amzn.to/2hESziD). For a while after its release, the price on Amazon had risen to 20,000 to 30,000 yen, but it settled down to 16,800 yen, so I grabbed it at that timing.

After reading the article [Itâ€™s been about two weeks since I bought the MISTEL BAROCCO MD600. - pockestrap](http://pocke.hatenablog.com/entry/2016/11/15/195008), I thought the distance it could be separated would be quite short as it is, so I also purchased a [1m Male-Male Micro USB](http://amzn.to/2hETtvH).

Here's how I've set it up. The included cable doesn't allow for this much separation, so I'm glad I bought the extra cable.

I chose the same brown switches that I had been using with my right-hand keyboard. Since I had never used a keyboard without arrow keys before, it took a bit of getting used to, but I can use it without any discomfort. I don't have many complaints, but I found it a bit annoying that there is a key printed with "Win," as it feels a bit dependent on a specific OS.

The posture is comfortable, and I've been told that I look like someone who can use a computer well, which is nice.
